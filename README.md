# OBS Display Capture Monitor for macOS

ðŸ”§ **Solution for frozen display capture in OBS on macOS!**

This script automatically detects and fixes the common issue where OBS display capture freezes on macOS. It works by monitoring the display capture output and automatically restarting it when frozen.

## The Problem This Solves

On macOS, OBS display capture sources often freeze after some time, requiring manual intervention to restart the capture. This script automates the fix by:
1. Detecting frozen frames by comparing consecutive screenshots
2. Automatically triggering the "Restart Capture" function
3. Keeping your stream/recording running smoothly

## Why Is This Script Necessary?

You might wonder why we can't just check the status of the "Restart Capture" button directly. The short answer is: **OBS does not expose that "is-stuck" flag through its public APIs (like obs-websocket) yet.**

The "Restart Capture" button you see in the OBS user interface is controlled by an internal state (`has_stalled`) that is:
*   Kept entirely inside the macOS Screen Capture source plugin.
*   Used only to enable/disable the button and log a warning.
*   Never broadcast or made available to external tools.

This means there is no direct way for a script to know when the button is clickable. Developers have requested this feature, but as of OBS versions 30/31, it has not been implemented. This script provides a reliable workaround by monitoring the *visual output* of the source instead of relying on an internal state we can't access.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Python** (if you haven't already):
   - Download and install Python 3.7 or later from [python.org](https://python.org)
   - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **Download this script**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/obs-display-monitor
   cd obs-display-monitor
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure OBS WebSocket**:
   - Open OBS
   - Go to Tools â†’ WebSocket Server Settings
   - Enable WebSocket server
   - Set a password (optional but recommended)
   - Note down the port number (default is 4455)

5. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   # Basic usage
   python obs_display_monitor.py --source "Your Display Capture Source Name"

   # With more options
   python obs_display_monitor.py --source "My Other Screen" --interval 0.5 --threshold 3
   ```

## Configuration

All configuration is done via command-line arguments. Here are the most common ones:

| Argument | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--source` | "Safari" | The name of your Display Capture source in OBS. |
| `--host` | "localhost" | The hostname or IP address of the computer running OBS. |
| `--port` | 4455 | The port for the OBS WebSocket server. |
| `--password` | "" | The password for the OBS WebSocket server. |
| `--interval` | 1.0 | How often (in seconds) to check for a frozen frame. |
| `--threshold` | 1 | How many identical frames to see before triggering a restart. |
| `--cooldown` | 30 | Minimum time (in seconds) to wait between restarts. |

To see all available options, run:
```bash
python obs_display_monitor.py --help
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **"Cannot connect to OBS" error**:
   - Make sure OBS is running
   - Check if WebSocket server is enabled in OBS
   - Verify the port number matches
   - Try without password first, then add password if needed

2. **"Source not found" error**:
   - Double-check your display capture source name in OBS
   - The name is case-sensitive
   - Make sure the source is in the current scene

3. **Script not detecting freezes**:
   - Increase logging level for more details
   - Try reducing monitor_interval to 0.5
   - Check if the source is actually visible in OBS

## How It Works

The script uses a smart detection method and a safe restart process to keep your stream running.

### 1. Freeze Detection
The script continuously monitors the display capture source by:
1.  Taking a small, low-quality screenshot of the source every second.
2.  Calculating a unique "fingerprint" (an MD5 hash) of the screenshot.
3.  Comparing this fingerprint to the previous one. If they are the same for a few checks in a row, the script concludes the source is frozen.

This method is highly efficient and reliable.

### 2. Restart Process
Once a freeze is detected, the script performs a safe restart that **preserves all your settings**:
1.  It first saves the current settings of your display capture source (which display it's capturing, whether the cursor is shown, etc.).
2.  It quickly toggles the capture type (e.g., from "Display Capture" to "Window Capture").
3.  It immediately toggles it back to the original type, using the saved settings.

This toggle forces OBS to completely reinitialize the display capture, which unfreezes it, all without changing your source's configuration.

## Requirements

- OBS Studio 28.0.0 or later
- Python 3.7 or later
- OBS WebSocket enabled
- Required Python packages (installed via requirements.txt):
  ```
  websocket-client>=1.8.0
  ```
